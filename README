# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accountants of the world, rejoice!  Watch in awe as sophisticated, recursive
tree structures flatten with ease.  Decantor is a tool to convert a list of 
arbitrary JSON objects ino an equivalent matrix/spreadsheet representation.

Currently only works on javascript arrays of json objects, due to the python
json library's predilection towards exporting them.

Example Usage: python decantor.py <json input> <csv output>

TODOS:
- Implement tests.  Fuzz testing could be neat.
- Support for other JSON list formats (newline seperated, MongoDB, etc.)
- Support for XML. (XML -> JSON -> CSV)
